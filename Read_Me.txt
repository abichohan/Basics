What is configuration?
- PyCharm uses config to run, debug and test code
- Each configuration is a named set of startup properties that define what to execute and what parameters and environment should be used.
- With different startup properties, you can define different ways that PyCharm uses to execute your script
- For example, you can execute the same code with different Python interpreters, providing various sets of environment variables, and getting input values from alternative files.


What is venv?
- Virtual environment
- Environment specific for this project
